#Standard output will be reditrected if we just use "> /dev/null" symbol.
##Example:
1.sh
ls -alrt > /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
echo "Command is Successful"
else
echo "Command is Failed"
fi

If you also want to redirect the error use "2> /dev/null" in the script.
Example:
2.sh
lserre -alrt 2> /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
echo "Command is Successful"
else
echo "Command is Failed"
fi
